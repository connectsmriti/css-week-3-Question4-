        <strong>Green Momo</strong> <br>
        Remember hating spinach as a kid? Well, hate no more! The dough for this spinach or green momos is made of spinach blended with flour and kneaded with the water from the spinach. Hence, the name and the color of the spinach. These momos are now available at many places but Alice restaurant at Gairidhara have one of the best green momos in K-town.

        <strong>Buckwheat (Phaphar) Momo</strong> <br>
        Available at Alice restaurant in Gairidhara, this momo can be a safe pick for the health conscious folks as the buckwheat momo packs in more protein and nutrients than its regular counterpart momos. The texture of this momo is incredibly light and is very tasty. Remember to eat them piping hot, as they tend to be a bit dry when they get cold.
